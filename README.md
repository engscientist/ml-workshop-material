# Machine Learning Workshop Material
These are the solutions to the practice problems I have given the students for the last workshop of the workshop series Introduction to MATLAB and Machine Learning (SUTD IAP 2020).

Please refer to the main documentation for this [here](https://github.com/engscientist/ml-workshop-material/blob/master/iris_docs.md).
